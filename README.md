# SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS

# My first horror terror
## was when i was 16 years old and one of my dreams was a cosmic horror from out of space that bent time to their own will

### In my childhood a practiced lots of lucid dreaming and found having weird dreams as a hobbie
### there was once a dream about me taking the bus to another place and ending up in the middle of nowhere, I saw the street in which the bus came from and thought "I just need to take another bus and return home", when I saw the opposite direction to where the bus came, I saw an indian Prince of Persia-like palace.

### Another one of the dreams I had was when I found a penny on the ground, I thought "hey I can buy something with this, what is its value?" and then there was a problem: the penny in question was... a bit weird, the imagery impritted on it was blurried and I couldnt distinguish the number written.
